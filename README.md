# Daily Professional Planner

## Description

This daily work planner allows the user to write down and save their schedule for each new work day. By clicking on the save button to the left of the chosen time block, the scheduled events will persist in the time block until they are revised at a later time. This can help the user with time management, remembering important meetings or other events, and help ensure that they accomplish all they set out to do each day. This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with API's including Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js.

## Credits

I used snipets of code from the following places:

- Code for making an enitre array uppercase <br>

    - [bobbyhadz.com](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-convert-all-elements-of-array-to-uppercase#:~:text=To%20convert%20all%20array%20elements,all%20strings%20converted%20to%20uppercase.)

- List of Special Characters <br>

    - [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters)

- Code for different types of pop up boxes <br>

    - [sebhastian.com](https://sebhastian.com/javascript-confirmation-yes-no/)

- Code for linking variables into the pop up boxes, linking user pop up selections to the password character options array, and generating a random loop from this array to create a random password. This youtube video offers a beginning to end solution to this challenge, but I only used the code base for the items listed above. <br>

The rest of the code you see is either original or taken from the University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp activities.

Enjoy!
